# TeamTimothy

##Intro
This project started as a part of [Makers Making Change's Access Makeathon] (http://www.makersmakingchange.com/accessmakeathonsummary/)
The goal is to help Timothy, a 10 year-old boy with ataxia, play his favourite games on Wii console. This project involves modifying a standard Nintendo Wii Remote and Nunchuk by replacing the buttons and joystick with larger versions and positioning them in a more ergonomic arrangement. The factory PCBs from the controllers are retained and new inputs wired to them.
